    <!--The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is in part to help structure the page so it is accessible to devices like screen readers. Additionally, having clear semantic tags makes your code much easier to read for other developers.

    I'm not entirely sure I understand the question regarding the order in which the browser displays HTML elements, but I think it is displayed in basically a top-to-bottom order, in the absence of instruction saying otherwise. I am pretty sure certain tags (e.g., header, footer) have self-contained instructions to be placed at certain positions on the page.

    I'm pretty excited about the Sublime snippet editor. I remember that being mentioned early on in the course material, but I had forgotten about it. I am sure I will use it a lot in the future.

    I think that the hardest concept for me was basically just figuring out the proper practices for where different semantic tags should be position in relation to one another. I think that this will become much clearer with more practice, and definitely with more exposure to other code that has been written by experienced developers.-->
